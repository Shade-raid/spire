Breaking the tower homage

The ancient Spire has dominated the island for centuries. Its dark presence corrupts the land, and only you can stop it. Build defensive towers, train mighty warriors, and launch wave after wave of attacks against the looming tower.

Will you slowly grind it down with automated defenses, or lead massive charges with your most powerful units? The choice is yours in this strategic incremental idle game.
